+# Solution Explanation: Adding a 404 Page
+
+## Issue Fixed
+GitHub Issue #104: Add a 404 page to the akhilkammila.github.io repository.
+
+## Changes Made
+
+### 1. Created `404.html` File
+- **Location**: `/workspace/job-728c1461-ccdc-4beb-8d75-acf75a475577-cursor/404.html`
+- **Purpose**: Custom 404 error page that matches the website's design and branding
+
+## Implementation Details
+
+### Design Approach
+I analyzed the existing website structure and created a 404 page that maintains visual consistency with the main site by:
+
+1. **Preserving Visual Identity**: Used the same color scheme (#faf0e6 background, #212529 text, #edb18d accent)
+2. **Maintaining Typography**: Applied the same font families (Abril Fatface for headings, Sen for body text)
+3. **Consistent Layout**: Used the same Bootstrap structure and responsive design patterns
+4. **Interactive Elements**: Included the custom cursor animation and hover effects
+
+### Key Features Implemented
+
+#### Navigation Bar
+- Replicated the exact navigation structure from `index.html`
+- Updated links to point to the main page sections
+- Maintained responsive behavior with Bootstrap collapse functionality
+
+#### Content Structure
+- **Large 404 Display**: Used the main heading style (h1) for the "404" text
+- **Clear Error Message**: Added descriptive text explaining the situation
+- **Action Buttons**: Provided two clear paths forward:
+  - "Go Home" button (primary action) - takes users back to the main page
+  - "Go Back" button (secondary action) - uses browser history to return to previous page
+
+#### Styling Consistency
+- **Color Palette**: Used the established color variables and custom properties
+- **Button Design**: Created buttons that match the site's aesthetic with rounded corners and hover effects
+- **Spacing**: Applied consistent margins and padding using Bootstrap classes
+- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the page works across all device sizes
+
+#### Interactive Elements
+- **Custom Cursor**: Included the same cursor animation system
+- **AOS Animations**: Added fade-up animation for the main content
+- **Hover Effects**: Applied consistent hover states for buttons and links
+- **Social Icons**: Included the same footer with social media links
+
+### Technical Implementation
+
+#### HTML Structure
+```html
+<!DOCTYPE html>
+<html lang="en">
+<head>
+    <!-- Same meta tags, Bootstrap CSS, custom CSS, and favicon -->
+    <title>404 - Page Not Found | Akhil Kammila</title>
+</head>
+<body>
+    <!-- Custom cursor div -->
+    <!-- Navigation bar -->
+    <!-- 404 content with showcase layout -->
+    <!-- Footer with social links -->
+    <!-- All JavaScript dependencies -->
+</body>
+</html>
+```
+
+#### CSS Integration
+- Leveraged existing `main.css` for consistent styling
+- Used CSS custom properties already defined in the stylesheet
+- Maintained the same responsive breakpoints and typography scales
+
+#### JavaScript Dependencies
+- Included all necessary scripts: Bootstrap, AOS animations, custom cursor, and Ion Icons
+- Preserved the same interactive functionality as the main site
+
+## Why This Approach
+
+### Design Consistency
+- **User Experience**: Users encountering a 404 error should feel they're still on the same website
+- **Brand Continuity**: Maintaining visual consistency reinforces the site's professional appearance
+- **Navigation Clarity**: Providing clear paths back to working content reduces user frustration
+
+### Technical Benefits
+- **GitHub Pages Compatibility**: GitHub Pages automatically serves `404.html` for missing pages
+- **SEO Considerations**: Proper HTML structure and meta tags help search engines understand the error
+- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML structure and proper contrast ratios ensure accessibility compliance
+
+### User Experience Enhancements
+- **Clear Communication**: Explains what happened and why the page isn't available
+- **Multiple Recovery Options**: Both "Go Home" and "Go Back" buttons provide flexibility
+- **Visual Hierarchy**: Large 404 number immediately communicates the error type
+- **Professional Appearance**: Maintains the site's polished look even in error states
+
+## Trade-offs Considered
+
+### Simplicity vs. Functionality
+- **Chosen**: Comprehensive 404 page with full site integration
+- **Alternative**: Minimal 404 page with just basic navigation
+- **Rationale**: The comprehensive approach provides better user experience and maintains brand consistency
+
+### Custom vs. Generic
+- **Chosen**: Fully customized 404 page matching site design
+- **Alternative**: Generic GitHub Pages 404 template
+- **Rationale**: Custom design reinforces the professional appearance and user trust
+
+### Content Depth
+- **Chosen**: Detailed error message with helpful context
+- **Alternative**: Simple "Page not found" message
+- **Rationale**: More information helps users understand what happened and how to proceed
+
+## Testing Considerations
+
+The 404 page will be automatically served by GitHub Pages when:
+- Users navigate to non-existent URLs
+- Links point to moved or deleted pages
+- Typos occur in URLs
+
+The page maintains full functionality including:
+- Responsive design across all device sizes
+- Interactive elements (buttons, hover effects)
+- Custom cursor animation
+- Social media links
+- Navigation to main site sections
+
+## Future Enhancements
+
+Potential improvements that could be added later:
+- Search functionality to help users find what they're looking for
+- Popular pages or recent content suggestions
+- Contact form for reporting broken links
+- Analytics tracking for 404 errors to identify common issues
+
+This implementation provides a solid foundation that can be extended as needed while maintaining the site's current design language and user experience standards.
